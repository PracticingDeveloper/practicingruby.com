<p>This project was started by <a href="https://practicingdeveloper.com">Gregory Brown</a> in 2010, and is meant to help software developers everywhere broaden their horizons and see their work in a new light.</p>

<h3>Want your own lessons to be featured here?</h3>

<p>
Thanks to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/828998531/practicing-ruby-contributors-fund">Kickstarter campaign</a> we ran in June 2015, Practicing Ruby is able to offer a modest honorarium of $500 for all guest collaborators.</p>

<p>If you're interested in contributing to Practicing Ruby, send a brief email about your idea to <a href="mailto:gregory@practicingdeveloper.com">gregory@practicingdeveloper.com</a>.<p>

<p>You do not need to be an experienced technical writer to participate! Collaborations typically consist of about three meetings with Gregory (60-90 mins each), and a few hours of solo research and development work to prepare notes and code samples over the span of a few weeks. Gregory will then prepare a writeup for your collaboration and publish it here.</p>
